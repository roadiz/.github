# ðŸš€ Roadiz v2 has launched

It's time to announce that Roadiz has shifted to a new major version and with this many big changes.
Roadiz v1 was built with legacy code and use Symfony Components and Pimple to refine and organize its code together.
Strong with our philosophy, we managed to improve and maintain many minor Roadiz v1 versions in order to offer more
features to our clients and to keep on creating custom experiences while using a strong and unique foundation.

Since 2020, our migration to *headless* stressed a lot Roadiz foundations with new challenges
and a brand-new workflow for our team. We needed a strong framework to rely on, thus we needed to implement
many new features to expose Roadiz unique architecture to a REST API. At the same time, our team developed
other applications with *Symfony framework* and *API Platform*. So we needed to merge
this expertise with Roadiz CMS more than ever.

We started rewriting Roadiz using Symfony Flex and API Platform in summer 2021. No more custom code for
*Kernel*, *Security*, exposing APIs, Debugging, User management, etc... We choose to develop Roadiz v2 as a Symfony Bundle
in order to bring what makes our CMS unique to an existing well-known ecosystem. For the moment, Roadiz v2 still rely
on legacy code, especially for its backoffice theme, but our CMS is ready to work with the whole Symfony ecosystem
and API Platform can now expose our whole CMS experience to create truly *headless* applications.

Roadiz v2 is a *Symfony Flex* application using at minimum these 4 bundles:
- [roadiz/core-bundle](https://github.com/roadiz/core-bundle)
- [roadiz/compat-bundle](https://github.com/roadiz/compat-bundle)
- [roadiz/rozier-bundle](https://github.com/roadiz/rozier-bundle)
- [rezozero/intervention-request-bundle](https://github.com/rezozero/intervention-request-bundle)

You can find these requirements in our [CMS pack](https://github.com/roadiz/cms-pack) or simply start
a new project using our [Roadiz Skeleton](https://github.com/roadiz/skeleton)

We are maintaining other optional bundles such as [User Bundle](https://github.com/roadiz/user-bundle) for public users management.
And we still are improving, refactoring Roadiz v2 while deploying it in production.

A lot of work remains to rewrite documentation and offer developers examples and case studies.
But this migration will offer lots of opportunities for new features and service integrations.
We hope that you will keep on looking at Roadiz development.
Our team is more than ever committed to develop on Symfony and PHP ecosystem.
