**Roadiz** is a polymorphic CMS based on a node system that can handle many types of services. 
It is based on *Symfony Flex*, *Doctrine ORM*, *API Platform*, *Twig* for maximum performances and security.

Roadiz node system allows you to create your data schema and to organize your content as you want. 
We designed it to break technical constraints when creating tailor-made websites architectures and layouts.

Imagine you need to display your graphic design portfolio andâ€¦ sell some t-shirts. 
With Roadiz you will be able to create your content forms from scratch and choose the right fields you need. 
Images and texts for your projects. Images, texts, prices and even geolocation for your products. 
Thatâ€™s why itâ€™s called polymorphic.
